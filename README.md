# Command Monitoring Script 

This script is designed to monitor any command being executed in the operating system and alert users if the command is deemed suspicious. The monitoring system includes features for retrieving system information, monitoring commands, suggesting countermeasures for identified threats, and performing file integrity checks.

### System Information Retrieval Module
The script utilizes a SystemInformationRetrieval class to gather key system information, including the operating system version, installed software, network configurations, and user privileges. This information serves as a baseline for identifying potential vulnerabilities and assessing overall system security.

### Command Monitoring Module
The CommandMonitoring class continuously monitors executed commands, comparing them against a predefined whitelist. If a command is not in the whitelist, it is flagged as suspicious, alerting users to potential security risks. This module aims to detect anomalous or malicious commands using various detection techniques, such as rule-based detection.

### Countermeasure Suggestion Module
The CountermeasureSuggestion class analyzes identified threats and generates context-aware countermeasure recommendations. It takes into account the specific system environment, potential vulnerabilities, and the nature of the detected threat to provide tailored and effective mitigation strategies.

### File Integrity Check Module
The FileIntegrityCheck class implements cryptographic hash-based file integrity checks. It calculates and verifies the hash of a specified file to ensure its integrity. This module aims to detect any unauthorized modifications to critical system files.

## Usage
To use the script, execute it in a Python environment. Upon execution, it will display the retrieved system information, continuously monitor commands, suggest countermeasures for simulated threats, and perform a file integrity check on a specified file.

## Secure Coding Implementation
The script incorporates secure coding practices to enhance system security:

### 1. Whitelist Command Execution:

  Only predefined commands are allowed, reducing the attack surface.
### 2. Limit File Upload/Download:

  Restrictions are implemented to prevent the introduction of malicious files or data exfiltration.
### 3. File Integrity Checking:

  Cryptographic hash-based checks are used to detect unauthorized file modifications.

## Scenarios without Secure Coding
The script highlights the potential impact of not implementing secure coding practices:

### 1. Malware Injection without Whitelist:

  Demonstrates the risk of allowing any command execution without whitelisting.

### 2. Unrestricted File Upload:

  Illustrates the danger of permitting unrestricted file transfers, potentially leading to system compromise.

### 3. File Exploitation without Integrity Checking:

  Emphasizes the importance of file integrity checks in preventing undetected modifications to critical files.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this script offers a comprehensive approach to command monitoring, threat detection, and secure coding implementation. By adopting these principles, users can significantly enhance their system's security and protect against a variety of potential threats.
